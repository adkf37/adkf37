## Projects

### 1. Plan for Chicago 2030
**Research Question:** How can interactive mapping and data-driven analysis inform comprehensive urban planning proposals for Chicago's land use, housing density, transportation infrastructure, and property values?

**Tags:** Urban Planning, GIS, Transportation, Housing Policy, Property Economics

**Repository:** [github.com/adkf37/Plan_for_Chicago_2030](https://github.com/adkf37/Plan_for_Chicago_2030)

### 2. US Health Disparities (USHD)
**Research Question:** What are the age-specific contributions to life expectancy gaps between different counties, and how can decomposition methods reveal disparities in mortality across demographic groups?

**Tags:** Public Health, Demography, Life Expectancy, Mortality Analysis, Epidemiology

**Repository:** [github.com/adkf37/USHD](https://github.com/adkf37/USHD)

## Ideas

1. **Predictive Crime Modeling ("Cops on the Dots")** - Can AI come up with good predictive models for where crime is going to occur? Use crime data to predict when and where next crimes will happen. Could you have an AI agent running this analysis every day/week based on new data?

2. **Malaria Mitigation Effectiveness** - Are some countries better at malaria mitigation than others? Comparative analysis of international malaria control strategies and outcomes.

3. **Demographic-Specific Homicide Rates** - Calculate demographic-specific homicide rates in different cities to understand who crime is affecting. IHME at UWash has published data for interpersonal violence and 20+ other causes of mortality by county, with race, gender, and age cohort breakdowns for 2000-2019.

4. **PARCC Performance Cohort Analysis** - Cohort analysis of performance on PARCC standardized tests in DC schools to track educational outcomes over time.

5. **Public Safety Officer Reform** - Convert all police and fire positions to a new combined "Public Safety Officer" role. Have them all be EMTs/paramedics with less fire-only apparatus manning and more 2-person vehicles capable of responding to medical calls.

6. **Chicago Governance Grand Bargain** - Restructure Chicago's government with 15 Council Members (12 districts, 3 at-large chairs for Education, Finance, Budget). Eliminate aldermanic privilege, Streets and San functions, and aldermanic menu. Mayor loses authority to appoint committee chairs and no longer presides over Council. Sister agencies brought under Council's authority with budgetary control and boards abolished.

7. **Housing Supply Impact Modeling** - Model the impact of creating X units on housing and rental prices. Calculate the city's housing stock deficit (similar to analysis showing San Francisco's 300,000 unit shortfall) to give people a sense of the problem scale and gauge actual solutions.

8. **High Murder Rates in Developing Countries** - Investigate causes of high murder rates in Latin American and African countries. Assess effectiveness of police deployment strategies, with consideration that police illegitimacy may be a more fundamental problem to solve first.

9. **Development Strategy for Unequal Middle-Income Countries** - What is the formula for jump-starting highly unequal middle-income countries like South Africa? Key policy questions: large education investments (how and with what labor force?), high-speed rail networks to reduce transportation costs and increase mobility for rural poor, and other essential development interventions.

10. **Federal and State Responsibilty Swap Proposal** - Have federal government assume state and local pension debt (create Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp) in exchange for eliminating state/local tax deduction and mortgage interest deduction. Could include sales tax vs. VAT swap element as well. Swap State and Local Medicaid responsibility (approx $200 billion) for Prek starting at age 3 in every school district in Country. Get rid of Head Start ($10 billion)
