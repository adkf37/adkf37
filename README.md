## Next Steps

I can help you:

1. **Populate the Featured and Full catalogue automatically** by fetching your public repos (requires permission/working GitHub API). I attempted this but hit an API/tool error (see note below).

2. **Manually fill in repo details**: Paste a list of featured repos (names + 1–2 line descriptions) and I will finish the README.

3. **Push this README to a repo**: Tell me a repo (`owner/repo`) where to push this README and I will create `README.md` there.

---

**Tell me which of the three options you want (manual fill, try fetching again, or push README to repo owner/repo) and I'll proceed.**
